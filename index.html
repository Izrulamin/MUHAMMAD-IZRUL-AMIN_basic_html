<p style = " color : blue ; " > <i> Get Organized. Making a plan for what you're going to do and when you're going to do it will make sure you're always ahead of the curve - literally. </i> </p>

<p style = " color : blue ; " > <i> Divide it up. Studying isn't fun to begin with, and forcing yourself through a study marathon will only make it worse. Dividing your work into manageable chunks and rewarding yourself when you finish each chunk will make studying (more) fun. </i> </p>

<p style = " color : blue ; " > <i> Sleep. Don't underestimate the importance of those eight hours of zzz's every night! Getting a good night's rest will sharpen your focus and improve your working memory. </i> </p>

<p> <center> <b> Find a study group. Sitting down with a group of people who are learning the same things as you is a great way to go over confusing class material or prepare for a big test. You can quiz each other, reteach material, and make sure that everyone is on the same page. After all, teaching someone else is the best way to learn. </p> </center><b>
